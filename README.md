# Pokedex

A Pokedex in your phone!

This app was taught to me in Harvard's CS50 course.

Features : 
  - shows which type of pokemon it is.  i.e bug, electric etc.
  - a small description about the pokemon
  - a search button
  - a catch/release button to remember which pokemon you caught.
  - a photo of the pokemon.
  
 *The debug-apk file is the output .apk file.*

Hope you like it!!!

Gotta Catch 'Em All!!
